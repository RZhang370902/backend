Hi, I'm Jane Smith, RN, and I'm conducting a head-to-toe assessment for John Doe in Room 305 at St. Mary's Hospital.
Starting with the neurological assessment, John is alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. He follows commands well, moves all extremities with purpose, and communicates his needs clearly. No numbness or tingling reported.
For HEENT, his head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat all appear normal—no swelling, discharge, or deformities. His mucous membranes are pink and moist, and he has no trouble swallowing or any signs of choking.
Respiratory-wise, his lung sounds are clear and equal on both sides. His breathing is normal and unlabored, and his chest moves symmetrically when he breathes. He denies any shortness of breath.
Moving on to cardiac, I hear normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with no extra sounds or murmurs. His heart rate is regular.
For peripheral vascular, his capillary refill is under two seconds, pulses are strong and palpable in all extremities, and there’s no edema.
His skin is warm, dry, and intact, with color appropriate for his ethnicity. No noticeable hair loss.
Musculoskeletal-wise, he has a full range of motion in all extremities without any pain, swelling, or tenderness.
For GI, his abdomen is soft, non-tender, and not distended. Bowel sounds are active in all four quadrants, and he denies any GI issues.
Genitourinary-wise, he’s voiding clear, yellow urine without any problems and has no urinary complaints.
Regarding sleep and rest, he reports no issues—no trouble sleeping or feelings of fatigue.
Finally, for psychosocial, he appears calm and cooperative.
Overall, John is stable, comfortable, and in no acute distress. I’ll continue monitoring as needed.
